# Analyzing-Star-Wars-Survey-Data

Before Star Wars: The Force Awakens came out, FiveThirtyEight conducted a survey on Star Wars fans using the online tool SurveyMonkey. The team wondered questions such as: does the rest of America realize that "The Empire Strikes Back" is clearly the best of the bunch? The survey consists of 835 total responses.

In this project we will be cleaning and analyzing the Star Wars survey dataset to answer questions on film popularity and rankings across segmented groups.
